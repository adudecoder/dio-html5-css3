                A server is actually just a big, powerful computer, but a commercial server isn’t like the kind of computer you might use to read this. A server doesn’t have the screen or keyboard. And although your computer stores files and data you’ve put on it, a server stores all the data associated with the websites that are hosted by it and shares that info with all computers and mobile devices (like yours) that need to access them. Your personal computer is designed to communicate with humans, but servers are designed to communicate with other computers.
